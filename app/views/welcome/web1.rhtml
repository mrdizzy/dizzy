		<h2>click.ink is a Web site that makes buying ink cartridges a breeze.</h2>
			<p>
			Ink cartridges are pretty boring, bless them. When you're buying an ink cartridge, you're not really interested in downloading Flash animations of a cartridge spinning in 3D, you just want to make sure it's good quality, relatively inexpensive, that you're buying the right one for your printer and that you can order it <i>quickly</i> without jumping through hoops.</p>
			<ul><li>We created a clean, simple design that was super-fast to load, easy to navigate and provided information such as estimated delivery times and stock levels clearly in a concise, obvious way.</li>
			<li>Customers want to order their ink cartridges fast, and they want information on their previous and outstanding orders displayed quickly and concisely. We instantly displayed this information for existing customers on the homepage if they chose to be remembered, allowing them to re-order with just one click. For new customers, placing a first order was easy: we didn't make them fill in a hundred questions spread over five different pages. </li>
			<li>We also needed to make sure the site was easy to administer from behind the scenes: handling customer emails and returns, adding new types of cartridges, applying refunds and showing stock levels were just some of the back-end features available in a completely Web-based control panel.</li></ul>
