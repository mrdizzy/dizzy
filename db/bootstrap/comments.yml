    Eva's version is beautiful but the real heartbreaking version is Christine McVie's (the song's composer) on Fleetwood Mac's Rumours. You picture her in a dark concert hall, alone with a piano, long after everyone has left, singing so sadly, so passionate - a cry out -how much she is in love.

  body: "I was so excited to hear about this until I discovered that it\xE2\x80\x99s just a spiffed up version of the deathly slow, click and hang, Eclipse IDE. There don\xE2\x80\x99t seem to be any improvements on speed because it takes over a minute just to start up on an Athlon 3500+ with 2GB RAM."

    It is very difficult to find a free IDE/text editor that supports SFTP \xE2\x80\xA6 anyone know of anything else?\r\n"
