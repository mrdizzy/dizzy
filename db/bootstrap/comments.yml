    Exactly what i mean.. it would be an "excellent" guide if it had drop syntax, that's not discourteous at all.

    This tutorial was exactly what I needed to get me started. My application needed attachments, and this helped me figure out the file upload portion. From there, it wasn't too hard to figure out how to associate the files with my other records, and I'm in business.
    
    Your step-by-step directions made this much easier than fiddling with one of the attachment plugins (and I'm speaking from frustrating experience here! :) ).

    undefined method `original_filename'
    
    And I put "validate_presence_of: image_file" in my "model"
    
    What is a problem?

    how do you limit the image size in your example?
    I mean if you use attachment_fu or something else you can easily 
    limit the image file size as well.
    I am using the same idea as yours, but did not get the file size problem right.

    The args for rename_table should be :old_table, :new_table (and rename_table is actually listed twice too).
