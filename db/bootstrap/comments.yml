    To create a bigint you need to set the integer limit to be between 5 and 8 bytes.
    
    The following example would give you a bigint with length 20:
    
    t.integer :foo, :limit => 8

    And here's some feedback: I think the "Visual representation of params" is unnecessary. The description of "params[]" just above it leaves no doubt about the organization of its content. So that space could be used for something else.

    I recently needed to do this for a pretty static site and didn't really want to use attachment_fu this time, so I used this as a guideline to see if I could do it. Based on previous comments I wasn't sure what the problems would be, but I had minimal problems, and they were all do to simple copy/paste errors (since I'm not doing quite the same thing). I have models, lets call them Animals, and they has_many photos (with photos being set up basically as above). Photos belongs_to Animals. Photo.rb has the def image_file=(input_data)
     code from above. In my animals controller I did add @photo = Photo.new(params[:photo])
     in the create action, and @photo = Photo.new in the new action (I used it for the fields_for in the view) and then I created a photos controller with the code_view code for displaying the image inline from the tutorial. It all worked perfectly.

    When I tried to upload my image I got an error saying:
    
         undefined method `image_file=' for #<Photo:0x2508aa0>
    
    I ended up changing the 'create' method from @photo = Photo.new(params[:photo]) to:
    
        @photo = Photo.new
        @photo.image_file(params[:photo]["image_file"])
    
    and that worked fine, but do you have any idea why I would be getting that error message?  It seems like I'm missing some elegant feature, which is causing me to have to do this in two steps... thoughts?

    This tutorial was exactly what I needed to get me started. My application needed attachments, and this helped me figure out the file upload portion. From there, it wasn't too hard to figure out how to associate the files with my other records, and I'm in business.
    
    Your step-by-step directions made this much easier than fiddling with one of the attachment plugins (and I'm speaking from frustrating experience here! :) ).

    how do you limit the image size in your example?
    I mean if you use attachment_fu or something else you can easily 
    limit the image file size as well.
    I am using the same idea as yours, but did not get the file size problem right.
