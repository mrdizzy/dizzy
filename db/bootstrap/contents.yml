  description: Learn how to upload files to the database, then retrieve and display them
  content: |-
    In this tutorial, I'll create a simple application to upload photos through a simple HTML form, and store them in the database, then render and display them on demand. The steps we'll go through are as follows:
    
    + *Create a model.* We'll use this model for the photographs, and we'll call it "Photo"
    + *Create a migration.* Use a database migration to create a table in the database to hold the photographs
    + *Handle the upload.* In the view, we'll create a template containing a HTML multi-part form and a corresponding action that will allow users to upload their photograph files
    + *Render the image from the database.* Once you've got the images in the database, how do you pull them out and display them again? That's what I'll show you...
    
    ### Building the foundations
    
    First things first: let's create the photograph model from the command line:
    
    ruby:
        ruby script/generate model photo
    
    The next step is in the controller. Let's create a **photo_admin controller** to take care of uploading, editing and deleting photos:
    
    ruby:
        ruby script/generate controller photo_admin
    
    We'll also use Rails' scaffolding generator to create some basic actions and views that we can edit and work with: 
    
    ruby:
        ruby script/generate scaffold photo photo_admin
    
    You might be asked by the generator script if it's okay to overwrite some of the existing controller files. Seeing as we haven't edited them even once, you can safely answer yes. 
    
    Using migrations, we'll create a simple table containing fields to hold a description of the image, along with a binary field that will hold the binary image data itself. Open the `001_create_photos.rb` migration in the `db/migrate` directory, and edit it as follows: 
    
    ruby:
        class CreatePhotos < ActiveRecord::Migration 
            def self.up create_table :photos do |t| 
                t.column :description, :string 
                t.column :content_type, :string 
                t.column :filename, :string 
                t.column :binary_data, :binary 
            end 
        end
    
    We can then run the migration from the command line:
    
    ruby:
        rake db:migrate
    
    If all has gone well, you should now have a table named `photos` in your database with all the fields you need to hold your image data! The next step is in the controller. Let's create a `photo_admin controller` to take care of uploading, editing and deleting photos:
    
    ruby:
        ruby script/generate controller photo_admin
    
    We'll also use Rails' scaffolding generator to create some basic actions and views that we can edit and work with:
    
    ruby:
        ruby script/generate scaffold photo photo_admin
    
    You might be asked by the generator script if it's okay to overwrite some of the existing controller files. Seeing as we haven't edited them even once, you can safely answer yes. 
    
    ### Creating a new photo
    
    Excellent! Now we have the foundations laid, it's time to handle uploading a new photograph to the database. As it happens, Rails' scaffolding generator has already created the new and create actions in the `photo_admin controller` we just generated, so we don't even need to touch it yet! Instead we'll concentrate on the view for the new action.
    
    To start with, we need to create a multipart form in the `new.rhtml` view template. This allows the browser to send image files (or any other kind of files) to the server. Let's change the existing `form_tag` helper to a `form_for` helper that will wrap our `photo` model object:
    
    rhtml:
        &lt;% form_for(:photo, @photo, :url => {:action=>'create'}, :html=> {:multipart=>true}) do |form| %&gt;
    
    Notice the `:multipart => true` option at the end of the tag. It's always good to use the brackets and braces for clarity when using `form_for` with a multipart option. So many errors will happen if the form isn't rendered correctly using `:multipart => true`, so it's a time saver to always make sure you get that bit right from the beginning!
    
    Next, let's remove the scaffolded entry for `&lt;%= render :partial => 'form' %&gt;` and instead add two form fields: one to handle the uploading of the photo, and the other to type in a description of the photo. 
    
    rhtml:
        &lt;%= form.file_field :image_file %&gt; 
        &lt;%= form.text_field :description %&gt;
    
    To create a field in the form which allows users to browse for and upload their files, we use Rails' specific file_field helper. It takes the same options as the `text_field`, the object assigned to the template (in this case, form) and the method for accessing a specific attribute (in this case `image_file`) Have you spotted the first anomaly yet? No? Well let's see: we've used :description in the text_field to enter our photo's description, and that's great, because we have a corresponding description field in our database table. But we've used image_file to upload our image data, and there's no corresponding `image_file` field in our photos table. So what's going on? 
    
    It turns out that when uploading a file, you don't get receive just one string, such as the binary image data, but a more complex object containing not just the file's binary data but its filename and content-type (such as `image/jpg` or `image/gif`). These are all stored together in :image_file, so what we'll need to do is extract the data and assign it the correct model attributes. The best place to do that is in the photo model, in app/models/photo.rb
    
    ruby:
        class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base 
          def image_file=(input_data) 
            self.filename = input_data.original_filename 
            self.content_type = input_data.content_type.chomp 
            self.binary_data = input_data.read 
          end 
        end
    
    Here, we take the contents of image_file and we use three methods to extract the data and assign it to the model attributes that match our database table: the methods are original_filename, content_type and read. 
    
    + `original_filename` gives you surprisingly enough the original filename of the file
    + `content_type` provides you with the content-type of the data, such as whether it is an `image/gif` or an `audio/wav` which is useful for validation 
    + `read` lets you actually get at the binary data 
    
    The `chomp` method at the end of `content_type` simply removes any extraneous newline characters, to make it neater. 
    
    Now, if you go to `yourapp/photo_admin/new` you should be able to upload a file. Try a small one at first (under 10k would be good) You'll know if it works because you'll be returned to the `/photo_admin/list` action, and you'll see the details of your file, along with a lot of gibberish under the binary column. That's because Rails is rendering your binary image data as text. Instead, we want a way to get the binary image data back out of the database and display it as an actual image... 
    
    ### Rendering an image stored in the database
    
    To do this, we'll create a new action in our `photo_admin` controller. We'll call it `code_image`: 
    
    ruby:
    	def code_image 
    	end
    
    In this action, we'll get the id (primary key) of the image file we want to display, we'll pull it out of the database and then we'll send it to the browser and tell it to render it correctly. Let's expand:
    
    ruby:
    	def code_image 
        	@image_data = Photo.find(params[:id]) 
        	@image = @image_data.binary_data 
        	send_data (@image, :type => @image_data.content_type, :filename => @image_data.filename, :disposition => 'inline') 
    	end
    
    Easy! In the above action we have: 
    
    + taken the `id` of the `Photo` from the params supplied by the form, and retrieved it from the database into the `@image_data` object
    + extracted the binary data out of the `binary_data` field
    + used Rails' `send_data` method to render the binary image to the browser
    
    The send_data method can take several options: 
    
    + `:filename` - suggests a filename for the browser to use
    + `:type` - specifies an HTTP content type. Defaults to `application/octet-stream`. We've used the existing `content_type` information that was stored in the database when we saved the image
    + `:disposition` - specifies whether the file will be shown inline or downloaded. Valid values are `inline` and `attachment` (default). We want the image displayed in the browser, so we've used inline.
    + `:status`- specifies the status code to send with the response. Defaults to `200 OK`. We don't really need to worry about this today.
    
    Test it out: go to `yourapp/photo_admin/code_image/1` (or whatever the id is of the image you want to display - make sure it is in the database!). If all is well, your image should be rendered in the browser. 
    
    ### Displaying the image inline
    
    Let's change the `show.rhtml` view for the `photo_admin` controller, so that instead of displaying a lot of gibberish, we can display the image itself under the "binary" column. If we open the `show.rhtml` view we should see the following: 
    
    rhtml:
    	&lt;% for column in Photo.content_columns %&gt;
        	&lt;%= column.human_name %&gt;
        	&lt;%=h @photo.send(column.name) %&gt;
    	&lt;% end %&gt;
    
    This code simply gets all of the column names from the database and their content and displays them automatically. This is fine for the text-based fields, but not for the binary image field. So we'll use an if condition to display the `binary_data` column differently:
    
    rhtml:
        &lt;% for column in Photo.content_columns %&gt; 
            &lt;%= column.human_name %&gt;
            &lt;% if column.name == "binary_data" %&gt;
                &lt;%= image_tag("/photo_admin/code_image/#{@photo.id}", :alt => "Image") %&gt;
            &lt;% else %&gt;
                &lt;%=h @photo.send(column.name) %&gt;
            &lt;% end %&gt;
        &lt;% end %&gt;
    
    Try it! Go to `yourapp/photo_admin/show/1` (or whatever the image id is you want to display) and your image should be displayed. In the above code, we're doing the following: 
    
    + looping through each column, and checking to see if the name of the column (column.name) is set to `binary_data`
    + if it is, then we use the `image_tag` command to render an image. The URL of the image is simply the action that we just created in the `photo_admin` controller to encode and render the image: `photo_admin/code_image/id` where id is the "id" of the image, in this case stored in the `@photo.id` instance variable
    + if the column name isn't `binary_data`, we just display the standard content of the column as text
    
    So now you have the `code_image` method in your `photo_admin` controller, whenever you want to encode and render an image inline, you just call `photo_admin/code_image/id` as the image URL. Simple! 
    
    # Troubleshooting Tips
    
    If you're getting NoMethod or other strange errors when uploading a file, try viewing the HTML of the new form after it has been rendered by your browser and before submitting it. Then you can make sure Rails is rendering the form correctly with the `multipart` entry. If you don't see `multipart` in the `<form>` tag, then that's your problem.

  description: A brilliant plugin that makes changing your database schema even easier and faster.
  content: |
    Auto migrations is a [plugin] [1] that will make changing your database even quicker and easier than using normal migrations. It's intended to be used in the early stages of your application development, when your database schema is fluid and constantly being changed. 
    
    ### schema.rb
    
    If you look in the `db` directory of your Rails application, you should find a file named `schema.rb`. This is a little bit like a consolidated migrations file, and contains the migrations syntax we have come to love and know so well:
    
    ruby:
        create_table "users", :force => true do |t|
          t.column "name",            :string
          t.column "hashed_password", :string
          t.column "salt",            :string
          t.column "firstname",       :string
          t.column "surname",         :string
          t.column "email",           :string
        end
    
        create_table "companies", :force => true do |t|
          t.column "name",        :string, :limit => 40
          t.column "description", :string
        end
    
    The auto migrations plugin enables you to edit your `schema.rb` file directly, and then run `rake db:auto:migrations` to have the changes applied automatically. That's right: there's no need to generate and edit migrations files, just edit `schema.rb` and the plugin will detect the changes you've made as soon as you run `rake db:auto:migrations`.
    
    ### Example
    
    In the above example, we have a `companies` table in our `schema.rb` file:
    
    ruby:
        create_table "companies", :force => true do |t|
          t.column "name",        :string, :limit => 40
          t.column "description", :string
        end
    
    Let's imagine that we want to add a new column--a string labelled `email` with a `limit` of 60 characters--to the `companies` table. We just edit `schema.rb` and insert an extra `t.column` line:
    
    ruby:
        create_table "companies", :force => true do |t|
          t.column "name",        :string, :limit => 40
          t.column "description", :string
          t.column "email",       :string, :limit => 60
        end
    
    Now, when we run `rake db:auto:migrations`, the email column will be added! Now is that magic, or is that magic? It works if you delete columns too. Just delete the line.
