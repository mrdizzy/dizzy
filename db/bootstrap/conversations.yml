    Hello, I was looking around the site and I was just wondering what is it exactly that you guys do? is it just a blog? But by the same token, I see a column for "Latest Work". Thanks!

    Hi, I was wondering what tool you used to author your cheatsheets. I'm learning a new package and would like to write a cheatsheet, (which I'm later going to publish), and I would like to make it look nice.
    
    Thanks, Sonia.
